Lab-on-chip (LoC) technology is becoming increasingly relevant, especially in the field of medicine. However, often LoC setups rely on complex lab equipment for operation. The aim of this project is to create an affordable and portable LoC setup as a proof-of-concept for truly pocket-sized LoC - the Pocket LoC.

Pocket LoC can be assembled with standard equipment found in a typcial engineering lab (such as a maker space or FabLab). Once assembled, Pocket LoC is fully portable and only needs a PC to operate.
